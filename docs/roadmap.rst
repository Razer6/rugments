Roadmap
=======

So what's on the roadmap after forking from rouge? Here is a small list.

* Implement caches for lexers, themes and formatters to avoid unnecessary loading.
* Make all rubocop tests pass. A well defined code style helps us to avoid bugs and to ensure a good overall code quality.
* Simplify themes.
* Provide a new and complete test suite.
* Improve documentation.

Last but not least:

* Port more lexers from pygments.
* Performance improvements.
